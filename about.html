                    Muse signed to Maverick Records and released their debut album, Showbiz, in 1999, showcasing Bellamy's falsetto and a melancholic alternative rock style. Their second album, Origin of Symmetry (2001), incorporated wider
                    instrumentation and romantic classical influences, and earned them a reputation for energetic live performances. Absolution (2003) saw further classical influence, with orchestra on tracks such as "Butterflies and Hurricanes",
                    and
                    became the first of
                    five consecutive UK number-one albums. Black Holes and Revelations (2006) incorporated electronic and pop elements, displayed in singles such as "Supermassive Black Hole". The album brought Muse wider international success. The
                    Resistance
                    (2009), loosely based on the novel 1984, and The 2nd Law (2012) explored themes of government oppression and civil uprising and cemented Muse as one of the world's major stadium acts. Their seventh album, Drones (2015), was a
                    concept
                    album about drone warfare and returned to a harder rock sound. Their eighth album, Simulation Theory, featuring a retro 1980s style, will be released in November 2018. </p>
                Muse have won numerous awards, including two Brit Awards, five MTV Europe Music Awards and eight NME Awards. In 2011, they received three Grammy Award nominations, of which they won "Best Rock Album" for The Resistance, and in 2012 they received a further two nominations, for "Best Rock Album" for The 2nd Law, and "Best Rock Song" for "Madness". In 2015, they received another nomination for "Best Rock Album" for Drones. Overall, Muse have received 47 awards from 136 nominations. They have sold over 20 million albums worldwide.
